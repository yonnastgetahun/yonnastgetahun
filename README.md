> AI Product Manager who ships models, not just roadmaps. I built a 3B-parameter VLM that generates real-time audio descriptions at **2.4ms latency** — 960x faster than GPT-4. I also build products across consumer, B2B SaaS, and hardware — from iOS apps to immersive entertainment systems. Previously at Zillow. Published poet. Former refugee turned builder.

## 🔭 What I'm Building

### 🎙️ [Visual Narrator](https://github.com/yonnastgetahun/visual-narrator-llm) — *AI-Powered Real-Time Audio Description*

A 3B parameter vision-language model that generates cinematic audio descriptions for visual media — making video accessible to blind and low-vision users in real time.

- ⚡ **2.4ms inference latency** (960x faster than GPT-4's 2.3s)
- 🎯 Beat GPT-4o on narrative quality benchmarks
- 🏗️ B2B2C for streaming platforms — professional-grade audio description at a fraction of traditional costs
- 📄 Patent pending: AI glasses cinema accessibility system with sub-100ms latency & spatial audio rendering

### 🧠 SciLogic — *Critical Thinking Trainer for the Misinformation Age* `iOS` `In Development`

A mobile app that builds real-world BS detection skills through 3-minute daily scenarios. Users evaluate viral claims, spot logical fallacies, and develop the reflex to question before sharing — progressing from reactive embarrassment to confident, articulate skepticism.

- 📱 iOS app with case-based learning and streak mechanics
- 🎯 5 transformation outcomes: confident pause, articulate disagreement, respected thinker, savvy skeptic, role model parent
- 📈 Progressive skill curve: pattern recognition (Week 1) → articulation (30 days) → identity shift (90 days)
- 💡 Positioned as personal training, not education — "Your BS detector for the modern world"

### 📚 Lendlee — *Community-Powered Lending Tracker* `iOS` `In Development`

A relationship-first app that tracks items lent to friends and neighbors with gentle automated reminders — so generosity never costs a friendship. Starting with books, expanding to tools, kitchen items, and more.

- 💚 Inspired by the Buy Nothing movement — mutual aid meets thoughtful UX
- 🔄 4-step flow: Add item → Choose person → Set reminder → Return & close loop
- 🎨 Warm emotional design: "Lending is generous. Forgetting is human."
- 🌱 [Landing page live](https://lend-a-hand-happy.lovable.app/)

### 📋 Continuity PO Maker — *Production Finance Workflow Tool* `Desktop` `Beta`

A privacy-first tool that turns W-9s and invoices into approval-ready purchase orders for film, TV, and commercial production teams. Local document processing — no cloud upload required.

- 🔒 Local-first architecture: sensitive financial data never leaves the browser
- 🎬 Built for production coordinators and line producers who live in spreadsheets
- ✅ Confidence indicators on extracted fields — AI-native trust UX
- 📄 3-step flow: Upload documents → Review & confirm → Generate PO as PDF

### 🌐 Cocoon "Grand" — *Private Immersive Sphere* `Concept`

A product vision for the world's first Personal Immersive Environment (PIE) — a 20-foot, 8K curved-screen home theater that brings the Las Vegas Sphere experience into private residences.

- 🖥️ 270° horizontal × 130° vertical wrap with seamless 8K Micro-LED canvas
- 🪑 D-BOX motion recliners with haptic feedback synchronized to content
- 🔊 128-channel Atmos spatial audio dome with ceiling-integrated speakers
- 🎬 Generative peripheral fill extends content beyond the 16:9 primary focus zone
